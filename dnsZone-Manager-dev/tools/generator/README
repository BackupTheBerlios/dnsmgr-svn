This Project tries to generate plain text Zonefiles from an LDAP Server with Entries associated with
the dnsZone-Schema from "http://www.venaas.no/ldap/bind-sdb/". With this you can use the LDAP based
DNS Management without the need to patch your bind9 with the bind-sdb patch.

Well, some Features from bind-sdb may be not useable with this method, but who knows :)
